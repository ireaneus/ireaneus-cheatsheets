# setuid bit (octal 4000) 
# When applied to an executable file, it sets the effective user ID 
# from that of the real user (the user actually running the program) 
# to that of the program’s owner
# When an ordinary user runs a program that is setuid root, 
# the program runs with the effective privileges of the superuser
chmod u+s program
-rwsr-xr-x

# the setgid bit (octal 2000)
# This, like the setuid bit, changes the effective group ID from that of the real group ID of the user to that of the file owner. If the setgid bit is set on a directory, newly created files in the directory will be given the group ownership of the directory rather the group ownership of the file’s creator. This is useful in a shared directory when members of a common group need access to all the files in the directory, regardless of the file owner’s primary group.
chmod g+s directory
drwxrwsr-x

# the sticky bit (octal 1000)
# On files, Linux ignores the sticky bit, but if applied to a directory, it prevents users from deleting or renaming files unless the user is either the owner of the directory, the owner of the file, or the superuser. This is often used to control access to a shared directory, such as /tmp.
chmod +t directory
drwxrwxrwt
