#### Execute commands on a remote Linux machine
ssh [USER]@[IP] [command or script]	ssh root@172.16.223.128 ls -l /root
#### Execute commands on a remote Linux machine


#### Run a Linux command after every reboot
$crontab -e
@reboot /home/xyz/myscript.sh
Do remember to enable crond on boot.

#### Comment out hashes in large configuration files
# Here is a small tip for system administrators, who need to tackle large configuration files,
# which include lots of commented lines (marked by #).
# With this tip you can remove all those hashes and provide only an uncommented configuration view for faster lookup into the file.

# If you want to check the configuration file of the Squid proxy server, run the following command:

cat squid.conf | egrep -v ^#

#### Comment out hashes in large configuration files


#### Know your shell
# Here is a command that will let you know about the available shells on your Linux distribution:
chsh -l

# To change your login shell, use the following command:
chsh
#### Know your shell

lspci		#Lists all PCI devices. Use -v for verbose output.
lsusb		#Lists all USB devices. Use -v for verbose output.
lsmod		#Lists the status of modules in the Linux kernel.
lsattr		#Lists file attributes on a second extended Linux file system.
lsof		#Lists the file descriptors opened by all the processes. A very useful command when a process fails to close any file descriptors.
lsb_release -a	#Here is a tip that will let you know the name of the OS, along with other details
dmidecode -t l  # List hardware information
dmidecode -s system-serial-number


#### Run a command as another user ####
/sbin/su -l user --command='service ma restart'

#### View the contents of tar and rpm files
# 1. To view the content of a tar file, issue the following command:

tar -tvf /path/to/file.tar

# 2. To view the content of an rpm file, use the command given below:
rpm -qlp /path/to/file.rpm
#### View the contents of tar and rpm files

#### Auto mounting a partition on Linux
sudo mkdir location_of_dir/name_of_dir
sudo gedit /etc/fstab

# The order should be as follows: the device name, the default mount point, the file-system type, mount options, dump, and the fsck option.

# The device name is the name of the HDD partition (such as /dev/sda5): the mount point is the full path of the directory where the partition is to be mounted.
sudo gedit /etc/fstab 

# The order should be as follows: the device name, the default mount point, the file-system type, mount options, dump, and the fsck option.

# The device name is the name of the HDD partition (such as /dev/sda5): the mount point is the full path of the directory where the partition is to be mounted. 
# The file system type is the type of file system like ext4, fat, ntfs, etc. Mount options are normally given as defaults, while dump and fsck options are given as 0.

# I had a partition /dev/sda5 and I created the directory /media/mydisk. My partition was of type ext4, so to my /etc/fstab, I added the following command:


/dev/sda5 /media/mydisk ext4 defaults 0 0

sudo mount -a
#### Auto mounting a partition on Linux

#### Troubleshooting a stale NFS mount ####
# if df -h is unresponsive try restarting nfs service
umount /mount
umount -f /mount
umount -lf /mount
service stop nfs
service start nfs
umount nfsmount
mount -a
mount -o remount,rw /opt	# if readonly mount exists

#### Working with log files
journalctl -xe			# systemd journalling search for errors
tail -f /var/log/messages secure
grep -Ei 'error|exception' /var/log/messages


# truncate an active log file
sudo truncate -s 0 ${LOGFILE}

# To install oracle or applications
sudo truncate -s 0 ${LOGFILE]

# and security has locked down /tmp - noexec
#
TEMP=/spacious directory
TMPDIR=/same dir
export TEMP TMPDIR
