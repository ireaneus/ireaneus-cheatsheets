## What does DD, DML, DCL stand for
- DDL is the abbreviation for Data Definition Language dealing with database schemas as well as the description of how data resides in the database. An example is CREATE TABLE command.
- DML denotes Data Manipulation Language such as SELECT, INSERT etc.
- DCL stands for Data Control Language and includes commands like GRANT, REVOKE etc.

## What are the types of joins
- In MySQL the Joins are used to query data from two or more tables. The query is made using relationship between certain columns existing in the table. There are four types of Joins in MySQL.
- Inner Join returns the rows if there is at least one match in both the tables.
- Left Join returns all the rows form the left table even if there is no match in the right table.
- Right Join returns all the rows from the right table even if no matches exist in left table.
- Full Join would return rows when there is at least one match in the tables.

## what is heap
> Basically HEAP tables are in-memory and used for high speed temporary storages. But TEXT or BLOB fields are not allowed within them. They also do not support AUTO INCREMENT.

## What are the different types of tables
- MyISAM is the default table that is based on the sequential access method.
- HEAP is the table that is used for fast data access but data will be lost if the table or system crashes.
- InoDB is the table that supports transactions using the COMMIT and ROLL BACK commands.
- BDB can support transactions similar to InoDB but the execution is slower.

## what about disk is full
> When the data disk is full and overloaded the way out is to create and soft link and move the .frm as well as the .idb files into that link location.

## How to optimize mysql query cache
```sql

### What is a .frm file
> FRM files are used to define the format of a table used with MySQL. MySQL is a cross-platform relational database. FRM files will have the same name as the table they reference, but with a .FRM extension. FRM files are created by MySQL when the table is created.
