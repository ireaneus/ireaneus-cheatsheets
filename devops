# Devops meaning

# Devops meaning: Devops is a cultural sensibility.
# It's a unified metrics based approach to making software
# efficiently and fearlessly using as much automation as possible.

# Sadly many companies don't have the will or discipline to foster a
# true DevOps culture, so they come up with the term "DevOps Engineer"
# to make it seem as if the DevOps sensibility has taken hold.*

# In reality they're just looking for infrastructure engineers who know
# how to work AWS or Google Cloud*
