# Google Cloud SDK tools support two authorization methods:
User account authorization
  User account authorization is recommended if you are running a script or other automation on a single machine

Service account authorization
  Service account authorization is recommended if you are deploying a script or other automation across machines in a production environment. It is also the recommended authorization method if you are running gcloud commands on a Google Compute Engine virtual machine instance where all users have access to root.

  gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file [KEY_FILE]
