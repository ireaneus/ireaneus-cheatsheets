# Mountkirk Games Case Study

# Company Overview
Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer
games for the most popular mobile platforms.

# Company Background
Mountkirk Games builds all of their games with some
server-side integration, and has historically used cloud
providers to lease physical servers. A few of their games
were more popular than expected, and they had problems
scaling their application servers, MySQL databases, and
analytics tools.

Mountkirk’s current model is to write game statistics to ¡les
and send them through an ETL tool that loads them into a
centralized MySQL database for reporting.

# Solution Concept
Mountkirk Games is building a new game, which they expect
to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game’s backend
on Google Compute Engine so they can capture streaming
metrics, run intensive analytics, and take advantage of its
autoscaling server environment and integrate with a
managed NoSQL database.

# Technical Requirements
Requirements for Game Backend Platform
Dynamically scale up or down based on game activity.
Connect to a managed NoSQL database service.
Run customized Linux distro.

Requirements for Game Analytics Platform
Dynamically scale up or down based on game activity.
Process incoming data on the ¢y directly from the
game servers.
Process data that arrives late because of slow mobile
networks.
Allow SQL queries to access at least 10 TB of
historical data.
Process files that are regularly uploaded by users’
mobile devices.
Use only fully managed services.

# CEO Statement
Our last successful game did not scale well with our
previous cloud provider, resulting in lower user adoption and
affecting the game’s reputation. Our investors want more
key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and
stability of the game, as well as other metrics that provide
deeper insight into usage patterns so we can adapt the
game to target users.

# CTO Statement
Our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we
need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an
environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load
balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.

# CFO Statement
We are not capturing enough user demographic data, usage
metrics, and other KPIs. As a result, we do not engage the
right users, we are not con¡dent that our marketing is
targeting the right users, and we are not selling enough
premium Blast-Ups inside the games, which dramatically
impacts our revenue.
