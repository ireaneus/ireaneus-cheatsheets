# ANSIBLE Modules
ansible -m setup all	# inventory of all systems

# Non SSH connection types:
local
# This connector can be used to deploy the playbook to the control machine itself.

docker
# This connector deploys the playbook directly into Docker containers using the local Docker client. Following parameters are processed by this connector:

ansible_host
# The name of the Docker container to connect to.

ansible_user
# The user name to operate within the container. The user must exist inside the container.

ansible_become
# If set to true the become_user will be used to operate within the container.

ansible_docker_extra_args
# Could be a string with any additional arguments understood by Docker, which are not command specific. This parameter is mainly used to configure a remote Docker daemon to use.

# Here is an example of how to instantly deploy to created containers:
- name: create jenkins container
  docker:
    name: my_jenkins
    image: jenkins

- name: add container to inventory
  add_host:
    name: my_jenkins
    ansible_connection: docker
    ansible_docker_extra_args: "--tlsverify --tlscacert=/path/to/ca.pem --tlscert=/path/to/client-cert.pem --tlskey=/path/to/client-key.pem -H=tcp://myserver.net:4243"
    ansible_user: jenkins
  changed_when: false

- name: create directory for ssh keys
  delegate_to: my_jenkins
  file:
    path: "/var/jenkins_home/.ssh/jupiter"
    state: directory

# vars playbook
--extra-vars "varname1= varname2="
