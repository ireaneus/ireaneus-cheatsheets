#### Awk is a programming language which allows easy manipulation of structured data and the generation of formatted reports
#### https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/01/awk-introduction-tutorial-7-awk-print-examples/
### Features include
# Awk views a text file as records and fields.
# Like common programming language, Awk has variables, conditionals and loops
# Awk has arithmetic and string operators.
# Awk can generate formatted reports

Awk Working Methodology
1. Awk reads the input files one line at a time.
2. For each line, it matches with given pattern in the given order, if matches performs the corresponding action.
3. If no pattern matches, no action will be performed.
4. In the above syntax, either search pattern or action are optional, But not both.
5. If the search pattern is not given, then Awk performs the given actions for each line of the input.
6. If the action is not given, print all that lines that matches with the given patterns which is the default action.
7. Empty braces with out any action does nothing. It wont perform default printing operation.
8. Each statement in Actions should be delimited by semicolon.

# Awk has number of built in variables. For each record i.e line, it splits the record delimited by whitespace character by default and stores it in the $n variables. If the line has 4 words, it will be stored in $1, $2, $3 and $4. $0 represents whole line. NF is a built in variable which represents total number of fields in a record.
