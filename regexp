# Regular Expressions
# In some ways, they resemble the shellâ€™s wildcard method of matching file- and pathnames but on a much grander scale. Regular expressions are supported by many command-line tools and by most programming languages to facilitate the solution of text manipulation problems.

# grep [options] regex [file...]
# options
-i	# Ignore case. Do not distinguish between upper- and lowercase characters. --ignore-case.
-v	# Invert match. Normally, grep prints lines that contain a match. This option causes grep to print every line that does not contain a match. --invert-match.
-c 	# Print the number of matches (or non-matches if the -v option is also specified) instead of the lines themselves. --count.
-l	# Print the name of each file that contains a match instead of the lines themselves. --files-with-matches.
-L	# Like the -l option, but print only the names of files that do not contain matches. --files-without-match.
-n	# Prefix each matching line with the number of the line within the file. --line-number.
-h	# For multifile searches, suppress the output of filenames. --no-filename.

# Metacharacters
^ $ . [ ] { } - ? * + ( ) | \

.	# grep -h '.zip' dirlist*.txt 	## Any character bunzip, bzip2
^	# grep -h '^zip' dirlist*.txt	## Regular expression is at beginning of line.
$	# grep -h 'zip$' dirlist*.txt	## Regular expression is at the end of the line.
[]	# grep -h '[bg]zip' dirlist*.txt	## expression is an or statement 'b or g'
[^]	# grep -h '[^bg]zip' dirlist*.txt 	## the remaining characters are taken to be a set of characters that must not be present at the given character position
^[]	# grep -h '^[A-Z]' dirlist*.txt	## entries start with a capital letter
