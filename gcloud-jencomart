## Sample Case Study: JencoMart

# Company Overview
JencoMart is a global retailer with over 10,000 stores in 16
countries. The stores carry a range of goods, such as
groceries, tires, and jewelry. One of the company’s core
values is excellent customer service. In addition, they
recently introduced an environmental policy to reduce their
carbon output by 50% over the next 5 years.

# Company Background
JencoMart started as a general store in 1931, and has
grown into one of the world’s leading brands, known for
great value and customer service. Over time, the company
transitioned from only physical stores to a stores and online
hybrid model, with 25% of sales online. Currently, JencoMart
has little presence in Asia, but considers that market key for
future growth.

# Solution Concept
JencoMart wants to migrate several critical applications to
the cloud but has not completed a technical review to
determine their suitability for the cloud and the engineering
required for migration. They currently host all of these
applications on infrastructure that is at its end of life and is
no longer supported.

# Existing Technical Environment
JencoMart hosts all of its applications in 4 data centers: 3
in North American and 1 in Europe; most applications are
dual-homed.

JencoMart understands the dependencies and resource
usage metrics of their on-premises architecture.

# CEO Statement
JencoMart will continue to develop personal relationships
with our customers as more people access the web. The
future of our retail business is in the global market and the
connection between online and in-store experiences. As a
large, global company, we also have a responsibility to the
environment through “green” initiatives and policies.

# CTO Statement
The challenges of operating data centers prevents focus on
key technologies critical to our long-term success. Migrating
our data services to a public cloud infrastructure will allow
us to focus on big data and machine learning to improve our
service to customers.

# CFO Statement
Since its founding, JencoMart has invested heavily in our
data services infrastructure. However, because of changing
market trends, we need to outsource our infrastructure to
ensure our long-term success. This model will allow us to
respond to increasing customer demand during peak
periods and reduce costs during off-peak periods.
